<h1>My Summer</h1>
<p>The summer of 2024 has been very busy. I am currently taking driver's training, playing volleyball and taking a web design class. I've also found some time to babysit and have some fun with my friends.</p>
<h3>Volleyball</h3>
<p>During my volleyball camp, we had a tournament style competition. We were all split into four teams and the winner received a large Little Caesar's cheese pizza. My team won!</p>
<h3>Babysitting</h3>
<p>This summer, I have babysit for four families. One of the families is my younger brother's friend, so he comes along to help. </p>
<h3> Driver's training</h3>
<p>I am also taking driver's training this summer. So far I have almost completed my Segment 1 class. Looking forward to being one step closer to getting my license.</p>
